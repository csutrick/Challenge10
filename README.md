# Challenge 14



## Description

This is a command line application built to help you generate SVG files that contain 3 letters and can be any color wether thats a word or a color code. You can also choose to have a background shape that can be a Circle, Square, or Triangle. Overall this was pretty straight forward, however i struggeled with importing the shapes file and using it. I think its because of the NPM version but i could not figure it out. So to fix this problem i put what would have been in my shapes file, i put into my index.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to launch the application
1. npm install
2. node index.js

## Usage

Follow the prompts givin to you, and give your input and desired colors. After you should see the .SVG in the same directory as the folder.
